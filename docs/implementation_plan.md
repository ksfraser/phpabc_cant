Project implementation plan and summary

Overview
- Goal: parse one or more ABC files (each file may contain multiple tunes), tokenize tunes into notes/barlines/voices/lyrics/canntaireachd (BMW), fix formatting, reorder voices according to DB order, ensure bagpipe voice has canntaireachd (generate from melody when missing), and output validated ABC.

## Completed Work

### 1) ParseContext Class ✅
- Introduced ParseContext class to hold parsing state (current voice, current bar, voice bars reference)
- Implements ArrayAccess for compatibility with existing handlers
- Provides helpers: getOrCreateVoice(), incrementBar(), etc.

### 2) AbcTune::parseBodyLines Update ✅
- Updated to use ParseContext for centralized state management
- Ensures default melody voice is created when notes appear prior to any V: header
- Eliminates null-offset errors and centralizes parsing state

### 3) Bagpipe Voice Management ✅
- Implemented via AbcCanntaireachdPass in the multi-pass processing pipeline
- Detects bagpipe tunes based on key signatures (D major, A major, etc.)
- Automatically creates "Bagpipes" voice if missing from multi-voice tunes
- Copies melody content from primary voice to Bagpipes voice

### 4) Voice Header Management ✅
- Implemented AbcTune::getLines() to return header/voice header objects for modification
- Fixed fixVoiceHeaders functionality operating over returned lines
- Proper voice header preservation and reordering

### 5) Canntaireachd Generation ✅
- Implemented AbcCanntaireachdPass for automatic canntaireachd generation
- Tokenizes note sequences and maps ABC tokens to canntaireachd using dictionary (longest-match-first)
- Converts ABC notes to canntaireachd syllables and adds as w: lines
- Provides validation and diff logging for canntaireachd changes

### 6) Comprehensive Testing ✅
- Unit tests for ParseContext, AbcCanntaireachdPass, and all new functionality
- Integration tests for parsing tunes with/without voices, multi-voice processing
- End-to-end CLI tests on test files including test-multi.abc
- Test coverage for bagpipe detection, voice creation, token conversion, and error handling

## Current Architecture

### Multi-Pass Processing Pipeline (AbcProcessor)
1. **Voice Detection Pass**: Identifies and validates voice structure
2. **Canntaireachd Generation Pass**: Generates canntaireachd from ABC notes for bagpipe tunes
3. **Voice Reordering Pass**: Reorders voices by channel with drums last
4. **Timing Validation Pass**: Validates bar timing and marks errors
5. **Output Generation**: Produces validated ABC, canntaireachd diff, and error logs

### Key Classes
- **AbcCanntaireachdPass**: Handles automatic canntaireachd generation and voice management
- **ParseContext**: Centralizes parsing state across handlers
- **TokenDictionary**: Manages ABC to canntaireachd token mappings
- **AbcProcessor**: Orchestrates multi-pass processing pipeline
- **AbcProcessorConfig**: Configurable processing options

### Features Implemented
- ✅ Automatic bagpipe tune detection
- ✅ Bagpipes voice creation and melody copying
- ✅ ABC to canntaireachd token conversion
- ✅ w: line integration with proper timing alignment
- ✅ Multi-tune file processing
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling and logging
- ✅ CLI and WordPress plugin support
- ✅ Full unit test coverage

## Design Principles Maintained
- Small, single-responsibility handlers (barline, lyrics, canntaireachd, notes)
- Dictionary-driven tokenization for ABC→canntaireachd mapping
- Configurable fixes (auto-apply vs report-only)
- Comprehensive logging of all automated changes
- SOLID principles with dedicated pass classes

## Current Status
All planned features have been implemented and tested. The system now successfully:
- Parses ABC files with multiple tunes and voices
- Automatically generates canntaireachd for bagpipe tunes
- Validates timing and structure
- Produces validated output with diff logging
- Supports both CLI and WordPress integration

Next actions: Maintain comprehensive documentation and test coverage as new features are added.
