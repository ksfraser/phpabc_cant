# Project Requirements: PHPABC Canntaireachd

## Overview
This project provides a PSR-4 compliant PHP library for working with ABC notation and canntaireachd, including utilities for parsing, simplifying, and converting musical notation. The codebase is designed for correctness, completeness, and maintainability.

## Functional Requirements

### 1. PSR-4 Compliance
- All classes must use proper namespaces and directory structure.
- Composer autoloading must work for all classes.

### 2. ABC Notation Support
- Parse ABC notation files and strings.
- Represent musical elements: notes, barlines, beats, voices, keys, embellishments, gracenotes, etc.
- Provide utilities for simplifying and converting ABC notation.
- Support dictionary-based conversions (Dict2php).

### 3. Canntaireachd Support
- Support conversion between ABC notation and canntaireachd (bagpipe vocal notation).
- Provide extensible base classes for future musical features.

### 4. File Handling
- Integrate with `ksf-file` package for robust file operations.

### 5. Testing & Documentation
- All classes must have PHPDoc blocks for IDE and documentation support.
- All classes must have unit tests verifying instantiation and basic behavior.
- Test coverage must be tracked and reported.
- Requirements, test plan, and test matrix must be documented in the repository.

## Non-Functional Requirements
- Code must be readable, maintainable, and follow modern PHP best practices.
- All dependencies must be managed via Composer.
- The codebase must be compatible with PHP 8.0+.
- All public APIs must be documented.
- The project must include a UML diagram of class relationships and message flow.

# Test Plan

## 1. Unit Testing
- Use PHPUnit for all unit tests.
- Each class must have a test verifying:
  - Instantiation
  - Basic method behavior (where applicable)
- Edge cases and error handling must be tested for core logic classes (e.g., AbcParser, Dict2php).

## 2. Integration Testing
- Test that Composer autoloading works for all classes.
- Test that ABC parsing and simplification work end-to-end.
- Test file operations using ksf-file integration.

## 3. Documentation Testing
- Verify that all classes have PHPDoc blocks.
- Verify that UML diagram is up to date and matches codebase.

## 4. Coverage Reporting
- Use PHPUnit's coverage tools to ensure all classes and methods are covered.
- Target: 100% class instantiation coverage, 80%+ method coverage for core logic.

# Coverage Reporting
- Run `vendor/bin/phpunit --coverage-html coverage` to generate coverage report.
- Review `coverage/index.html` for gaps and improve tests as needed.

---

# Additional Notes
- All requirements, test plans, and test matrix must be kept up to date as the codebase evolves.
- All new features must include corresponding tests and documentation.
