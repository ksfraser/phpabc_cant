# SOLID/DRY/SRP/DI/MVC Audit Summary Report

## Strengths

- **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):**
  - Each pipeline pass (e.g., `AbcTuneNumberValidatorPass`, `AbcLyricsPass`, `AbcCanntaireachdPass`) has a focused, well-defined responsibility.
  - `AbcProcessingPipeline` orchestrates the workflow without embedding business logic.
  - Parsers and utility classes are modular and separated by concern.

- **Dependency Injection (DI):**
  - Dictionaries, configuration, and sub-parsers are injected via constructors or method parameters, not hardcoded.
  - Pipeline passes can be composed and extended easily.

- **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself):**
  - Common logic is factored into helpers, traits, and utility classes.
  - No major code duplication in core pipeline or parsing logic.

- **Open/Closed Principle (OCP):**
  - New passes can be added to the pipeline without modifying existing code.
  - The design is extensible for new validation or transformation steps.

- **Documentation:**
  - PHPDoc and UML annotations are present for most public classes and methods.
  - Class-level docblocks describe responsibilities and dependencies.

## Violations & Areas for Improvement

- **Interface Segregation / Liskov Substitution:**
  - Pipeline passes do not implement a common interface (e.g., `AbcPipelinePassInterface`). This can hinder type safety and future extensibility.

- **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):**
  - Some utility classes (e.g., `AbcProcessor`) contain static methods for multiple concerns (lyrics, voice, tune splitting). Consider further decomposition.

- **DRY:**
  - Minor duplication in tune/voice parsing logic across different classes. Refactor to centralize repeated regex or parsing patterns.

- **Error Handling:**
  - Some error handling is generic (catch-all exceptions). More granular exception types and messages would improve debuggability.

- **Documentation:**
  - Some methods and classes lack detailed PHPDoc, especially in utility and trait classes.
  - UML diagrams are present but may not reflect the latest architecture after recent refactors.

## Recommendations

1. **Introduce a Pipeline Pass Interface:**
   - Define an interface (e.g., `AbcPipelinePassInterface`) with a `process(array $lines): array` or similar method. Have all passes implement it for type safety and consistency.

2. **Decompose Utility Classes:**
   - Refactor `AbcProcessor` and similar classes to move unrelated static methods into focused helper classes.

3. **Centralize Parsing Logic:**
   - Extract common regex and parsing routines into shared utilities to reduce duplication.

4. **Enhance Error Handling:**
   - Use more specific exception classes and error messages in passes and pipeline orchestration.

5. **Improve Documentation:**
   - Ensure all public classes and methods have up-to-date PHPDoc.
   - Update UML diagrams to reflect the current architecture.

6. **Consider MVC for CLI/GUI:**
   - If expanding to a web or GUI app, formalize separation of model, view, and controller layers.
